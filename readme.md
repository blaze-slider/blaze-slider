# Blaze Slider

Blaze slider is a high-performance JavaScript UI library for creating sliders.

## The Problem

Existing slider libraries are not designed with performance in mind. They block the main thread for a long time when initializing a slider which results in poor UX and poor [FID](https://web.dev/fid/) metric for your website.

They also create layout shifts that negatively impact the UX and [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) metric of your website. These libraries don't provide any idiomatic way to reduce the layout shifts.

## The Solution

Blaze slider is built to fix these issues. It can initialize the slider incredibly fast. It initializes the slider **30x faster** than the Slick slider, and **15x faster** than the Swiper slider.

Blaze Slider allows you to specify the layout configuration via CSS variables which enable slider initialization with <span className='wow'>zero layout shifts!</span> - so that your slider will look exactly the same before and after javascript runs.

## Benchmark

| Rank | Library   | Time    | Speed              |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | Blaze ⚡️ | 2.1ms   | **1**x             |
| 2    | Glide     | 12.2ms  | **5.8**x _slower_  |
| 3    | Flickity  | 13.29ms | **6.32**x _slower_ |
| 4    | Swiper    | 29.8ms  | **14.2**x _slower_ |
| 5    | Slick     | 60.0ms  | **28.5**x _slower_ |

Benchmark measures the time taken to create a slider with 10 slides by each slider. Benchmark is measured on Apple M1 Pro CPU with 6X slowdown on Google Chrome 103

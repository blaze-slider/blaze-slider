## Why Blaze Slider?

Most slider libraries weren't built with performance in mind. They block the main thread during initialization, hurting your [FID](https://web.dev/fid/) scores and user experience.

They also cause layout shifts - elements jump around as JavaScript loads, damaging your [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) metrics. And they don't offer clean ways to prevent this.

## How Blaze Slider is Different

Blaze Slider was designed from the ground up for speed and stability.

- **30x faster** initialization than Slick
- **15x faster** than Swiper
- **Zero layout shifts** - CSS variables define the layout before JavaScript runs

Your slider looks identical before and after hydration. No flicker, no jumps.

## Highlights

- The most performant slider library
- Zero layout shifts via CSS configuration
- Rich feature set: touch, drag, autoplay, pagination, navigation, infinite loop
- Responsive configuration using CSS media queries
- No slide cloning (eliminates a whole class of bugs)
- Full TypeScript support
- Tiny bundle size (~2KB gzipped)

## Performance Comparison

| Rank   | Library    | Init Time | Comparison          |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| **1**  | **Blaze**  | **2.1ms** | -                  |
| 2      | Glide      | 12.2ms    | 5.8x slower         |
| 3      | Flickity   | 13.3ms    | 6.3x slower         |
| 4      | Swiper     | 29.8ms    | 14.2x slower        |
| 5      | Slick      | 60.0ms    | 28.5x slower        |

Benchmark: 10-slide slider initialization on Apple M1 Pro with 6x CPU throttling in Chrome 103. All libraries use identical configuration and content.
